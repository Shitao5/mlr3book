Welcome to the **M**achine **L**earning in **R** universe.
This is the online version of the upcoming book *Applied Machine Learning Using mlr3 in R*.
This book will teach you about the `mlr3` universe of packages, from machine learning methodology to implementations of complex algorithmic pipelines.
We will cover how to use the `mlr3` family of packages for data processing, fitting and training of machine learning models, tuning and hyperparameter optimization, feature selection, pipelines, data preprocessing, and model interpretability.
In addition we will look at how our interface works beyond classification and regression settings to other fields including survival analysis, clustering, and more.
Finally, for readers interested in technical details, we will look at implementation and decision decisions, as well as error handling and parallelization.

We hope you enjoy reading our book and always welcome comments and feedback.
If you notice any mistakes we would appreciate if you could open an issue in the [mlr3book issue tracker](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3book/issues).

If you have any questions about licensing just [open an issue](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3book/issues) and we will be able to help you out.

### Community Links

The mlr community is open to all and we welcome everybody, from those completely new to machine learning and R to advanced coders and professional data scientists.

The [mlr3 GitHub](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3) is a good starting point for links to cheatsheets, documentation, videos, slides, overview tables, and pointers to other packages.
If you want to chat to us, you can reach us on our [Mattermost](https://lmmisld-lmu-stats-slds.srv.mwn.de/signup_email?id=6n7n67tdh7d4bnfxydqomjqspo).
For case studies and how-to guides, check out the [mlr3gallery](https://mlr-org.com/gallery.html).

We appreciate all contributions, whether they are bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests that fix bugs or extend functionality.
Each of our GitHub repositories includes issues and pull request templates to ensure we can help you as much as possible to get started.
Please make sure you read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your first issue or pull request.

With so many packages in our universe it may be hard to keep track of where to open issues, as a general rule:

1. If you have a question about using any part of the `mlr3` ecosystem, ask on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and use the tag #mlr3 -- one of our team will answer you there.
Be sure to include a reproducible example ([reprex](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)) and if we think you found a bug then we will either refer you to the relevant GitHub repository or we will open an issue for you.
1. Issues or pull requests about core functionality (train, predict, etc.) should be opened in the [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr3) GitHub repository.
2. Issues or pull requests about learners should be opened in the [mlr3extralearners](https://github.com/mlr3extralearners) GitHub repository.
3. Issues or pull requests about measures should be opened in the [mlr3measures](https://github.com/mlr3measures) GitHub repository.
4. Issues or pull requests about specialized functionality (e.g., pipelines and tuning) should be opened in the GitHub repository of the respective package.

Do not worry about opening an issue in the wrong place, we will transfer it to the right one.

Bernd Bischl is a professor of Statistical Learning and Data Science in LMU Munich and co-director of the Munich Center for Machine Learning.
He studied Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and holds a PhD in statistics.
His research interests include AutoML, model selection, interpretable ML and the development of statistical software.
He wrote the initial version of mlr in 2012 and 2013 and still leads the team of developers of mlr3, now largely focusing on design, code review and strategic development.

Raphael Sonabend is an open source manager at Genomics England and a visiting researcher at Imperial College London.
They hold a PhD in statistics, specializing in machine learning applications for survival analysis.
They wrote the mlr packages mlr3proba and mlr3benchmark.

Lars Kotthoff is an associate professor of Computer Science at the University of Wyoming, US.
He has studied and held academic appointments in Germany, UK, Ireland, and Canada.
Lars has been contributing to mlr for about a decade.
His research aims to automate machine learning and other areas of AI.

Michel Lang is the scientific coordinator of the Research Center Trustworthy Data Science and Security.
He has a PhD in statistics and has been developing statistical software for over a decade.
